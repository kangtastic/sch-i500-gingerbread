TKSGB KERNEL SOURCE REPOSITORY

Linux 2.6.35.7 kernel for SCH-I500 devices running Gingerbread and TouchWiz, based on Samsung's EH09 source drop for Mesmerize.


BUILDING

Obtain and install/unpack an appropriate toolchain such as Sourcery Lite arm2009q3 (recommended by Samsung). Note that toolchains targetting only the ARM EABI cannot cross-compile useful things like busybox, but both should work for the kernel.

Make the necessary edits in the source tree to point to the location of the toolchain:
build.sh - TOOLCHAIN, TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX
src/kernel/Makefile - CROSS_COMPILE

If desired, edit the build scripts and ramdisk to suit your needs, such as removing references to TKSGB. The scripts and ramdisk structures are pretty easy to figure out.

Run ./build.sh or alternatively ./build_log.sh to log screen output while building. Output will be in out/ and will include Odin- and CWM-flashable packages.
